Problem 1: Using sobel algorithm  and Thresholding 



1. Sobel and Robert with Threshold :


Sobel Kernel Gx = [-1 0 +1;  -2 0 +2;  -1 0 +1];        Gy = [+1 +2 +1;  0 0 0; -1 -2 -1];
Robert Kernel Gx = [0 0 0;   0 1 0;  0 0 -1];		 Gy = [0 0 1;   0 -1 0;   0 0 0];

2. Set manual thresholds to the resultant Gradient Image in GrayScale: 
   Sobel:       Gradient Mag >230  255 
   		       Gradient Mag< 230 is 0
                
   Robert:      Gradient Mag >30  255 
   		       Gradient Mag< 30 is 0

3. I have used Zhang Suen algorithm for thinning 
     Pixel Form :  P = 
               P9 P2 P3
        			P8 P1 P4
        			P7 P6 P5

     Parse 1: 
               P = [P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P7 P8 P9 P2]
               Checking Parse 1 conditions
               1. P1 is black
               2. Number of nonZero pixel neighbours of P1 is between and 6
               3. Number of 0 to 1 transition in [P2...P9,P2] is measured by count.
 	            4. P2*P4*P6 = 0?
               5. P4*P6*P8 = 0?
    Parse 2:
               The rule from 1 to 3 are the same but 4 and 5 are:
                4: P2*P4*P5 = 0 
                5:P2*P6*P8 = 0


To Run Sobel with Threshold:  [gradientMag, gradientDir] = sobel(‘test1.png’)
To Run Robert with Threshold: [gradientMag, gradientDir] = robert(‘test1.png’)
To Run ZhangSuenThinning algorithm: ZhangSuenThinning(‘test3.gif’)
